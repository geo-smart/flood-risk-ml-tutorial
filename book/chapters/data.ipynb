    "Our goal is to predict a building's type (Residential/Commercial/Industrial) based on known features of the building (area, location, etc.). To accomplish this, we gather as many building features as possible from open datasets. We begin with as large a set as possible and will work towards identifying each feature's actual importance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our sources of building features are [Open Street Map (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org), the [Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC)](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/type/urban-imperviousness), [United States Census' County Business Patterns (CBP)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/data/tables.html), and the [United States Census' American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've preprocessed the data to spatially align all the features. For example, we used building longitude and latitude provided by OSM to determine which county the building resides in. We've then gone to the ACS and looked up socio-econimic data such as median income and housing density. The resulting machine learning ready data looks like this:\n",

    "The last column, 'BuildingType', is what we are trying to predict. [USA Structures](https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures) is an open source building inventory provided by the Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The building inventory contains a Building Occupany Type, which was determined through census and U.S. mail data. Currently, Building Occupancy Type values are availble for nine states. However, we note that not every building in those nine states has a manually identified occupany type. We are using North Carolina Building Occupany Type data as our \"ground-truth\". If we can predict known building types well, the machine learning models can be reliably deployed on unknown buildings and in states where Building Occupany Type is unavailable.\n",

    "The raw data used to create our machine learning ready data was too large to include on GitHub with this tutorial.
