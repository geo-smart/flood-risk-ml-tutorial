    "# Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure has a single parameter called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into. As such, the procedure is often called k-fold cross-validation. In this tutorial, we split our training data into 5 groups, thus k=5 and our approach is refered to as 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning applications, we need to split out data into a training set (what is used to train the machine learning model) and a test set (a portion of data not used in training and reserved for evaluating how well the model is working). Cross-validation allows every data point to be used for both training and evaluation. It also helps us identify if any random splitting of the data results is drastically different performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general procedure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shuffle the dataset randomly.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into k groups\n",
    "3. For each unique group:\n",
    "    Take one group as the test data set\n",
    "    Take the remaining groups as a training data set\n",
    "    Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "    Retain the evaluation score and discard the model\n",
    "4. Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tutorial notebook utilized 5-fold cross validation in all training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide examples of saving Machine Learning models as [Pickle files](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html) as well as with the Joblib approach, which is often preferred as it offers model compression and smaller file sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Feature importance is a technique for assessing how important each of our input features are to making accurate predictions. Features with low importance do not contribute much (are not used/do not have much weight) to prediction accuracy. Low importance features can be ignored creating simpler more scalable machine learning modesl.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a technique called [Permutation Importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/permutation_importance.html) in which features are randomly shuffled. If a column's values can be randomly shuffled and prediction accuracy does not decrease, then that feature has low importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of permutation importance and the retraining of models using fewer features is provided.\n"
