While extreme weather is a primary driver of flooding, its consequences depend on the interconnectedness of urban systems - referred to as the Urban Multiplex, which includes the power grid, transportation network, natural surface water and groundwater systems, sewerage and drinking water systems, intertwined with the socioeconomic and public health sectors.</p>"

Accurate and standardized information about buildings (e.g. classification into residential, commercial, industrial) is critical for assessing the number of people affected by flooding, the propagation of shocks throughout the economy, and for forecasting detailed socioeconomic risk from flooding. Yet, a major discrepancy exists in the way data about buildings are collected across the U.S. There is no harmonization in what data are recorded by city, county, or state governments, let alone at the national scale.</p>"

The data used in this tutorial is consistently and openly available for the continental Unites States. We use the state of North Carolina as an expemplar in this tutorial.</p>"

Many classification algorithms will return a probability of class membership where all values equal or greater than a threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to the other class. The default of many algorithms is to set the threshold at 0.5. Threshold moving simply moves the threshold attempting to achieve higher accuracy."
